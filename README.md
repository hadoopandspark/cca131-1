In this post, we’ll go through the CCA131 exam blueprint topics and show you what and how to perform the tasks in each topic.

All the embedded links are my exam preparation notes. Go through each link and perform/practice it in your cluster.

Check out my post on Minimum cluster configuration required for practice.

Please practice till the time you’re confident of doing all the tasks without referring any documentation/material and capable of resolving the issues.


Before we start, check out my post on exam feedback.  CCA131- Exam Feedback

If you’re new to Linux, please check out Linux commands – Basics which will help you get familiar with shell commands.

UPDATE: 

After getting many requests from the followers on the exam question format, I created a post contains sample exam questions. Please check it to get an understanding of how the problems will appear in the exam.
